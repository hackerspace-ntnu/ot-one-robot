# RPi Setup
#
# This will move all the build files and set up the directory structure on an
# RPi.  If you're running this locally, just set pis to localhost in your
# /etc/ansible/hosts file.
#
# You can connect to just one RPi, or a whole bunch of them through an
# ethernet router. It all depends on your /etc/ansible/hosts file.
#
# If you don't have any builds, you'll need to run rpi_build.yml first.
