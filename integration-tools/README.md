# Integration Tools
The integration possibilities with Opentrons are almost endless. This repository is meant to be a non-comprehensive collection of guides and tools for how you can use certain external devices with the robot, without having to modify the Opentrons source code.

These solutions are not part of the Opentrons production codebase and are not guaranteed to work across all software versions. They should instead be seen as a set of tips and starting points to help avoid common integration-related stumbling blocks.
