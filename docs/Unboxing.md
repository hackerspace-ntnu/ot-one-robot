# Unboxing

Taking your robot out of the box, putting it together, and getting ready to plug it in.

1. Remove the robot from the box, Styrofoam, and plastic covers.
2. Connect the Z-axis to the X-Y gantry. (more detailed instructions to come)
3. Remove all the shipping security bolts. There are 11 total, and each is covered with blue packing tape.
4. Move the gantry around by hand. Make sure that it can move smoothly on the X-Y axis.

OK, when you can move the robot freely with no power, its time to get things connected!
